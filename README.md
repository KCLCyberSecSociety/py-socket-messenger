# Python TCP Client-Server Socket Messenger

## Description

This tutorial will show you how to write a simple TCP socket client-server messenger in Python3 using python's standard `socket` module. We will use the `ssl` module to provide TLS to encrypt our messages securing our connection from malicious actors.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial:

+ [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version 3 or higher is required, including the command line tools so that we can execute python from our terminal. 

+ For Part2, having [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) installed on you system would be beneficial, however, you can use the keys and certificates provided.

+ A code editor would also come in quite handy; you can use Python IDLE or Visual studio code or even notepad.
