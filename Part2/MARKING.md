# Automated test guidance

The automated tests expect the following:

- Client recieves "Hello Client!" from server and prints it to the console
- Server recieves "Hello Server!" from client and prints it to the console
- Both client and server terminate after sending and recieving messages
- Both client and server terminate within 10 seconds

The tests ignore whitespace and capitalisation, and any other output.
